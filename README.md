# todolist

Todolist using Spring Boot and React


This is a web application using Spring Boot and React. This project has two parts. First part (todolist-spring) is the backend part and it has services and controllers that the frontend parts (todolist-react) need. 

Here is the things to do if you want to use this project;

- Create database named 'todolist' on Mysql (I am using Code First method so you don't need to create any table. Code makes it by itself.)

- On the todolist-spring/src/main/resources/application.properties change the 'username' and 'password' parts for your database credentials. After that convert 'update' to 'create' for create tables on your Mysql database (After first execution you can change it back).


Finally the project ready to start.
